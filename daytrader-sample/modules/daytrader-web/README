This is a version of daytrader which is able to running on a server which has only web 
container, for example, Tomcat.

Compared with the full version of Daytrader, these features are removed from this version:
1. EJB 3 with CMP and JPA
2. Web Service Access
3. The application clients, such as streamer and wsappclient.


BUILD

Build from the root of daytrader source code tree:
 $ mvn install


INSTALL

To Tomcat 6:
By default, it uses Derby database. You can change src/main/webapp/META-INF/context.xml
to use other database vendor. Remember that copying database jdbc drivers to tomcat lib
directory. After building, just deploy the .war file in the target directory to tomcat with 
context root /daytrader.

To Little-G:
Of course, it works as well as on Little-G with Tomcat 6. Before deploying it 
to Little-G, you need to deploy a datasource first. File "daytrader-datasource-plan.xml" 
has Derby as an example. You can follow these steps to deploy it to Little-G:
1. Start Little-G, and install System Database module from online plugin repositories
 $ <Little-G HOME>/bin/deploy.sh search-plugins http://geronimo.apache.org/plugins/geronimo-2.2/
Choose "Geronimo Plugins, System Database :: System Database" to install

2. After successfully installed System Database module, deploy the sample datasource:
 $ <Little-G HOME>/bin/deploy.sh deploy \
	<Little-G HOME>/repository/org/tranql/tranql-connector-derby-embed-xa/1.4/tranql-connector-derby-embed-xa-1.4.rar \
	<Daytrader ROOT>/plugins/daytrader-derby-datasource/target/work/plan.xml

3. Deploy .war file
 $ <Little-G HOME>/bin/deploy.sh deploy <PathToWARFile>


UNINSTALL

On Tomcat 6: Just remove daytrader folder from <TOMCAT HOME>/webapps.

On Little-G: 
 $ <Little-G HOME>/bin/deploy.sh undeploy org.apache.geronimo.daytrader.assemblies.web/daytrader-web-jdbc/2.2/war
