This itests uses the rfc 138 impl in unreleased equinox 3.6(which you can obtain from OSGi repo if you are an OSGi alliance member).  pax runner seems only have experiemental support for equinox 3.6 M4, which is 3.6.0.v20091204 and doesn't provide the CompositeAdmin service.   You will need to obtain the equinox 3.6 prototype jar and rename this jar to osgi-3.6.0.v20091204.jar and put it in .m2/repository/org/eclipse/osgi/3.6.0.v20091204/.  Having the jar in your local m2 repo will prevent pax runner from downloading the jar.
