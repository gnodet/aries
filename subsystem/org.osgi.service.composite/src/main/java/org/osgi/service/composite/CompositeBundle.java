/**
 * A composite bundle is a bundle for which the content is composed of meta-data 
 * describing the composite and a set of bundles called constituent bundles.
 * Constituent bundles are isolated from other bundles which are not 
 * constituents of the same composite bundle.  Composites provide isolation
 * for constituent bundles in the following ways.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Class space: Constraints specified by constituent bundles (e.g.
 *     Import-Package, Require-Bundle, Fragment-Host) can only be resolved
 *     against capabilities provided by other constituents within the same 
 *     composite bundle (Export-Package, Bundle-SymbolicName/Bundle-Version).</li>
 * <li>Service Registry: Constituent bundles only have access to services 
 *     registered by other constituents within the same composite bundle.  
 *     This includes service events and service references.</li>
 * <li>Bundles: Constituent bundles only have access to other Bundle objects 
 *     that represent constituents within the same composite bundle.  This 
 *     includes bundle events and core API like BundleContext.getBundles, 
 *     PackageAdmin and StartLevel.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A parent framework refers to the OSGi framework where a composite bundle 
 * is installed.  A composite framework refers the framework where the 
 * constituent bundles are installed and provides the isolation for the
 * constituent bundles.  Constituent bundles are isolated
 * but there are many cases where capabilities (packages and services) need 
 * to be shared between bundles installed in the parent framework and the 
 * constituents within a composite bundle.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Through a sharing policy the composite is in control of what capabilities
 * are shared across framework boundaries.  The sharing policy controls what
 * capabilities provided by bundles installed in the parent framework are 
 * imported into the composite and made available to constituent bundles.
 * The sharing policy also controls what capabilities provided by 
 * constituent bundles are exported out of the composite and made available
 * to bundles installed in the parent framework.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The lifecycle of the constituent bundles are tied to the lifecycle of 
 * the composite bundle. See {@link #start(int)}, {@link #stop(int)}, 
 * {@link #update(Map)} and {@link #uninstall}.
 * </p>
